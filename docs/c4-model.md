# C4 Model

## C1 level

On the C1 level you can see the outline of the two systems that our user will interact with. On the left we have the software we are building, Playlistify.me. On the right is Spotify, the system that our project will interact heavily with and our user will too.

## C2 level

On the C2 level we zoom in to the Playlistify.me System context. In here, we can see the different apps that make up our system: A web interface, back-end API (Spring boot), and a database.

## C3 level

On the third level of the model, we zoom in to the back-end api app. This app mainly consists of two big parts: one component to handle user authentication, and one component to handle the merging of playlists. Both components have to interact with the Spotify system, which they do through making API calls.
